# How developing your minimal LOVABLE product will delight users
While the minimal viable product is focused (MVP) to test the market and validate an idea, the minimal lovable product (MLP) is designed to additionally delight and engage users, which will ultimately drive adoption. In this session, you will learn how to define this MLP so that you know which features to build and how to make users fall in love with your app. You will learn why creating a strong emotional connection with your users starts duding development and not afterwards in marketing. Communicating the value proposition is not anymore something that happens after a release, but we need to shift-left here and put people front and center. Thinking not only about basic user needs, but building something that relates to them is at the very core of highly successful software development.
